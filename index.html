            <h3>Every idea <span><img src="assets/img/idea.png" alt="GlÃ¼hbirne"></span> starts with a need</h3>
            <p>Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve my design skills and
                attract more customers. I wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper
                and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more sense with
                what I thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user interface, I really
                liked the idea, but the problem was that the result was just something nice and did not solve any
                problem.

                            perfect.
                            You
                            will learn to accept feedback and learn from it.
